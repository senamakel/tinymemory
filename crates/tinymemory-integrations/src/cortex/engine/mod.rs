//! [`CortexEngine`]: TinyMemory's recall, fetch, store, list and forget over
//! CortexDB's event log.
//!
//! Each operation lives in its own module:
//!
//! - `store` — one path for `store` and `store_many`: replay detection by
//!   item label, then each item's experience (or ordered batch of turns),
//!   then the readability waits;
//! - `list` — a cursor over the kind scopes' listings, each item once;
//! - `fetch` — hybrid retrieval through recall packs, ranked by the engine;
//! - `recall` — one pack, one answer, citations from the pack;
//! - `forget` — look the items' events up, remove them by `memory_ids`;
//! - `consolidate` — one `v1/beliefs/build` per held scope in reach.
