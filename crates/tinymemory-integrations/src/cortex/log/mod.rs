//! CortexDB as an append-only event log: the raw operations the engine is
//! built from.
//!
//! # Engine behaviours this module is shaped around
//!
//! Each was measured against a running CortexDB by the v1 adapter, and each
//! was wrong in that adapter first. The test doubles reproduce all of them.
//!
//! - **It is append-only.** `/v1/experience` only appends; there is no
//!   update. A body `idempotency_key` replays the same body for 24 hours
//!   (`replayed_from_idempotency`) and refuses another body (409); forget by
//!   `memory_ids` releases it (0.10.4). Keys are derived from the body, so a
//!   retry is a replay (`transport::body_idempotency_key`).
//! - **Accepted is not readable.** `/v1/experience` answers `202 captured`
//!   and indexes afterwards. Writes wait (see `visibility`): first until the
//!   listing carries the event, which is fatal on timeout, then until ranked
//!   recall does, which is best-effort. `/v1/experience/status` and the
//!   advertised lifecycle stream are not readiness signals.
//! - **The listing emits every event twice**, and `limit` counts the
//!   duplicates. Readers dedupe by event id and follow
//!   `cursor`/`next_cursor`/`has_more`; a full walk refuses past
//!   [`MAX_PAGES`] rather than answering from a truncated log.
//! - **Unknown query parameters are ignored, not refused**, so a wrong
//!   paging parameter re-serves page one for ever. The parameter is exactly
//!   `cursor`, and a cursor that does not advance is an error.
//! - **A pack's events carry the stored text.** 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 put the
//!   `[role] ` marker only in `context_block` and the index copy; an older
//!   recall prefixed it to `layers.events` text, which the v2 decoder still
//!   tolerates (see `Envelope::decode`).
//! - **The forget selector's id field is `memory_ids`.** An unrecognised
//!   field reads as an *empty* selector, which means the whole scope. This
//!   crate never sends an empty selector and never sends `confirm_all`.
//! - **A forget by `memory_ids` takes what was derived too.** On 0.10.4,
//!   `layers: ["events"]` (what this crate sends) and `layers: []` alike
//!   delete the named raw events *and* every fact, belief, episode and
//!   understanding record that cites them; records derived from other events
//!   stay. A `layers` list without `events` deletes nothing. (0.9.9's default
//!   kept raw events.) It is not a GDPR erasure: that is `v1/erasures`.
//!
//! On the TinyHumans wire the backend also rate-limits a user to 300
//! requests a minute, has no bulk, `?wait=indexed` or health route, and
//! takes an `Idempotency-Key` claim on every write (see `write`).
