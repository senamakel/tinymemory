//! [`AgentMemory`]: one agent's memory lifecycle over any engine.
//!
//! A host calls it at fixed points of the agent loop. Every read is a
//! [`crate::recall`] over the [`MemoryLayout`]'s scopes; every write is one
//! turn at this agent's node; every slow step is a [`BackgroundJob`] handed
//! back for the host to run.
//!
//! | When | Call | Engine work |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | session start, before any user turn | [`AgentMemory::start_session`] | reads only |
//! | user turn, before the model | [`AgentMemory::pre_turn`] | logs the turn (accepted, not indexed) while fetching the pack |
//! | first user turn after a compaction | [`AgentMemory::pre_turn_resumed`] | as `pre_turn`, with the thread's earlier turns leading the same pack |
//! | after the reply | [`AgentMemory::post_turn`] | logs the reply; may return a belief build (never on an engine that builds on its own) |
//! | prompt truncated | [`AgentMemory::recall_for_compaction`] | an answered summary of the thread, plus related memory |
//! | any time | [`AgentMemory::recall`] | a pre-turn pack without logging |
//! | off the turn | [`AgentMemory::run_background`] | the job |
//!
//! The hot path — `pre_turn` and `post_turn` — never waits for indexing and
//! never runs a model: writes use [`tinymemory_api::WaitFor::Accepted`] and the pack is
//! ranked retrieval ([`SectionQuery::Fetch`]). Logging runs concurrently
//! with the read, and the pack never contains the turn being logged or the
//! part of the thread still in the prompt.
//!
//! A pack's sections, highest priority first (budget trimming takes from the
//! last): **Learnings**, one section per [`CoreScope`], **Brain**, **This
//! agent's history**, and **Team conversations** (other agents' turns). An
//! item appears once, in the first section that found it.
//!
//! Core scopes share memory above the layout, such as a hive-wide core or a
//! company brain. They are empty by default; [`AgentMemory::with_core`] sets
//! them, and because the memory is cheap to clone a host can override them
//! for one call: `memory.clone().with_core(scopes)?.pre_turn(turn)`. Only the
//! host writes there, through [`AgentMemory::promote`]; the model's tools
//! never choose a node.
//!
//! Each turn is stored as its own one-turn conversation item carrying the
//! thread id, the turn's index, the agent id and the `conversation` source,
//! so a retried call with the same input is a replay, not a duplicate.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use tinymemory_api::conformance::ReferenceEngine;
//! use tinymemory_tools::{
//!     AgentMemory, Brain, BrainDocument, BrainSource, MemoryLayout, PostTurn, PreTurn,
